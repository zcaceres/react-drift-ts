# react-drift-ts

## What is it?

A tiny Typescript-ready React widget for [Drift.com](https://www.drift.com)'s chat widget. Built with NextJS in mind.

## Why?

The go-to widget for Drift integration is [react-driftjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-driftjs). This widget hasn't been updated in years and has React 16 as a peer dependency which can prevent deployment. This project owes a bunch of its code to the original package. ðŸ«¡

## Setup

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

## To Use

Copy index.ts into your project and use it!
